# Foodie - [Website](https://rubinbarclay.github.io/Foodie/)
A recipe website built using the [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) API. I realized after I started building with it, that it's limited to only 100 recipes for non patreon supporters, like me. So it's not as cool as I originally thought but still works just like I had in mind.

**NOTE** To avoid any unsuspected errors please use live-server when playing around with it. Had issues running the scripts on chrome when I opened the files locally with the browser. It only seemed to work when using live-server.
